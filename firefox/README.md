# Huemix-Blopscotch Browser Addon (Firefox)

## What it does

Injects Hopscotch tour javascript pre-requisites and supporting javascript code segments to support dynamic parsing and assessment of web tours
defined with a crowd-sourced github repository.

## What it shows

A strawman design of a loosely coupled architecture between a web tour framework browser extension and the actual tour definitions themselves.
